        <p class="editable uppercase margin-heading">Sam Whitehead</p>

        <div class="editable">
            <p>Born in Northern England in 1995, Sam Whitehead was raised amidst the enduring influence of the built environment. His working class perspective of architecture embodied a profound connection between individuals and the spaces they inhabit.</p>
            <p>Sam’s passion for architecture encompasses the idea of designing places in which people’s lives and stories take place. Perhaps influenced by a childhood surrounded by theatre and a family of actors, he is inspired by a building’s ability to become the stage for human interaction and connection. Architects have a crucial role to design our city as a theatre of experience, and Sam adeptly applies this principle to champion positive social change.</p>
            <p>Sam studied architecture at the University of Nottingham and a Masters at the University of Westminster. His experience both privately and with world renowned practices such as Foster + Partners, Grimshaw, and Marek Wojciechowski Architects,  demonstrates his ability and passion. Sam prides himself on designing well-detailed buildings within the budget and programme.</p>
            <p>Sam found that studying architecture soon became a lifestyle; an ongoing development in approaches and outlooks which, in turn, developed a strong sense of self. Sam constantly strives to compliment design with experience, and continues to travel; providing great insight into the parallel notions of place, culture and identity.</p>
            <p>Breaking away from the corporate nine-to-nine grind of a disoriented industry, Sam combined his passion for travel with an unwavering drive to explore cultural identity in architecture. After traveling the world and experiencing diverse architectural styles and cultural influences, he found his true calling in Bali, where he felt an undeniable connection to the island's rich heritage and natural beauty, prompting him to establish his studio and weave his global experiences into locally inspired designs.</p>
